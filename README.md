# Unity_StoneThrower
Project about a stone thrower game for PC 


The game has 3 levels of difficulty: easy, moderate and hard. Easy is settled as default value.

The goal of the game is achieve more than 55 points by breaking stones of different colours before a fixed amount of time (60 seconds). Each stone has a diferent value.

Red = 2
Green = 4
Purple = 10
Yellow = -30

After 60 seconds, the results of the match will be displayed in a different panel alongside two options of restart the game or go back to the menu.

Some improvements for the game are still left like:

-Adaptation for mobile devices (graphical performance improvement, multithouch methods)-
-Increasing of performance for the explosion objects.
-Fix some lightning effects during the stone thrower stage.
-Adding more customizable options for the settings menu.
